Closing Talks
-------------

* Speakers
  * Eric Ries & Chris Dixon (Andreeson Horowitz)

* Why are new methods necessary? Why is the pace of change changing?

* Now, it's about taking tech to other traditionally not tech-integrated
  industries
  * Tech is no longer "in its corner", it's spreading out

* Within industries, how to choose good investments?
  * Mutli-stage investing. Seed -> Series A -> Series B -> Later stage growth
  * Seed: technical entrepreneurs
  * Early stage: Consumer apps, social networking, messaging. Based on metrics, growth
  * At core: ppl w/ special expertise (Founder <-> Market fit)
    * If doing something technical: they have phD
    * Domain expertise: came from the industry of the problem they're solving
    * Cultural expertise: part of movement (AirBNB / cultural movement)

* How to know when you're ready to send to Andreeson-Horowitz?
  * Tend to lean toward early-stage
  * Software-related

* What's different about starting company today vs before?
  * There was close to no learning resources
  * Cost to getting started -- not as much open source
    * Start small, stay on same platform. Infrastructure didn't exist
    * Not just AWS -- also Google adwords
  * Used to be 10's of millions to get started -- run your own data center
  * Size of market has changed -- 80% of adults by 2020 will be internet connected
thing

* Big "cast of characters" behind just founder

* Venture backed startup == 5-10 years. Big investment

* Questions
  * As an investor, how do you think about the future? What mental models?
    * We don't know, nobody knows. Also no idea about the economy.
    * No one can predict the future
    * "What the smartest ppl do on the weekend is what ppl will do in 10 years"
    * What's interesting that ppl outside of Silicon Valley are doing?

  * Hiring is one of most important things. There are budget constraints. How to balance
    hiring really good ppl vs good ppl that get the work done
    * Implicit assumption: correlation between quality of employees and what they're paid
    * Motivation comes not just from monetary compensation, but from culture,
      quality of product, quality of environment, etc

  * Have an accountability partner for what you're doing
    * It's easy to become convinced you're on the right track
    * Don't work for them, but have them be a person to bounce ideas off of
      * Need someone to call you on your BS
      * Have you learned something of value?
        Are these experiments testing the right things?

  * Org charts
    * Are ppl _really_ equal? Or are you just obfuscating structure?
    * Many cases where ppl dabble in it
    * Alleged counterexamples, but employees say otherwise
      * Million things to iterate on in startup, but some things should stay
        constant: org structure, law advice, etc
      * For first company, innovate on product / tech, not org structure
      * Top-down org chart is not mutually exclusive to applying lean methodology
        * To what purpose is the structure being used, regardless of structure
