* Data -- needs vs wants
  * Questions
    * What questions have you asked yourself about your audience or potential audience?
      * How did you answer those questions?
    * Strong NEED to get valid answers, but weak WANT for answers they're expecting

  * Findings
    * Asking the right questions, but answers to those questions were wrong

  * VCs
    * How do you decide to invest? What do you ask of companies?
      * Even worse answers

  * Top asked questions
    * Who are my questions?
    * Is there a market need?

  * Organize into groups based on product development process
    * Strategize
      * What do ppl need? Who are users, how do ppl solve problem? How to ppl
        find stuff?
    * ...
    * ...

  * Even Elon Musk confuses needs and wants?
    * Asked question about needs on twitter, got answers about what ppl want

  * Takeaway: asking ppl directly for what they NEED generally prompts them
    to reveal instead what they WANT

  * Needs: come from demonstrated behavior, real life problems. Stable.
  * Wants: fluid, changes.
