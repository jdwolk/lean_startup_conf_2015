Eric Ries Keynote
-----------------

* Lean startup is still new even though we feel like latecomers
  * Vast majority of ppl not familiar w/ it yet

* Resistance to lean startup
  * Ppl used to doing things a certain way
  * Many ppl still working in the "old way"

* Old way
  * Waterfall, silos, convinced know what ppl want.
  * Beauracracy, slowing down
  * Inevitable for big companies? No

* Cliches
  * Big business - "we want to think like a startup"
  * Who's in charge? Usually, "everyone".
    * Everybody's job = nobody's job
  * Who sets standards for success that still permit entr. thinking?
    * Most middle managers paid to make sure innovation doesn't happen

* Management theory
  * All about standardization, eliminating innovation
  * Good for situations of certainty

* Question: What does it mean to be a modern company where innovation is welcomed?

* Strands of thought
  * Hypergrowth sil. valley startups
  * Large companies
  * Governments

* Healthcare.gov
  * BDUF, silos, no accountability, etc.
  * Compares to other companies
  * Try it -- are we doing the same at our company?

* Think about: are you ready for "that moment" when lean is inevitable in the company
  * Once you reach tipping point, happens very fast
