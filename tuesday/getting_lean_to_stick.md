Getting Lean To Stick
---------------------

* Speaker
  * Jenna Cember -- co-founder of GE fastworks

* Problem
  * Employees / customers said they were too slow
  * Q: How to change the way they work?

* Start
  * Restructured mgmt
  * Created centers of expertise
  * Simplified, but weren't any faster

* Question
  * Can we use lean startup and bring into GE for machine products?

* Inital receiption
  * After training, leaders went back to environments, no one understood how
    they were working

* Created initiative called FastWorks
  * Took lean startup methodology, applied to GE concepts / values, branded
    for them
  * Educated leaders, talking about how environment needed to be set up
    differently
  * Created coaches to bring expertise in-house
    * Trained on FastWorks + change mgmt techniques to get through roadblocks
  * Introduced more broadly in company

* Results
  * Got into markets faster, reduced cycle time, orders from customers before
    solutions presented

* Re-assess
  * How to apply more broadly at GE? How to apply to ANY task, in company?
    * i.e. developing set of slides: who is audience? What are assumptions
      and how can I test them?

* How to give employees permission to work like this?
  * Not only is it ok, it's what is expected?
  * Re-defined company values

* Launched differently
  * Typically, launch like this would be top down (300,000 employees in 175 countries)
  * This time: engaged sr. leaders, then went to middle of org
    * Middle of org has toughtest time
    * Looked for early-adopters
  * Employees asked: how long will these last?
    * Answer: don't know
    * Expectation: to stay relevant, look to "bedrocks" of org and evolved them

* Post-launch assessment
  * HR: Used Performance Management system. Is that still appropriate?
    * Original program introduced in 1976, very little change
    * Considered industry standard
  * Used FastWorks to redesign performance development system
    * Wanted visible example of dogfooding the methodology

* Process for imrproving their perf. mgmt. system
  * Start: who is customer?
    * End users are employees, mgrs, sr leaders
  * What are their needs / what is a successful outcome?
  * Created leap-of-faith assumptions
  * Tested w/ small groups
  * Iterated against learning metrics

* Said out front: it's not perfect, but we're going to grow it
* Moved from heavy annual perf. evaluation process -> ongoing
* Built in ability to provide feedback
  * Employee -> Mgr, Colleague <-> Colleague

* Major cultural shifts in-company now?

  * Prescription -> Discovery
    * Used to be good at knowing the answer up-front / first
      * Went to customer, "I know what you need"
      * Also applied internally
    * Needed to teach each other how to discover, ask questions before
      presenting solutions

  * Command and Control Leadership -> Empowerment
    * Discipline / rigor were important internally
      * To be faster, needed to push decision making to customers
    * Needed to empower teams, trust them, and let go
      * Diff. leadership style

  * Activities -> Activities & Impact
    * INternally, dashboards / checklists were good. Completion == success
      * Now ask: to what end?
    * Redefine successful outcomes / impacts

* Iteration
  * Come from 6 sigma legacy
  * 6 sigma still in toolkit
    * No longer applied to EVERYTHING, just quality control of manufacturing
    * FastWorks strength
      * Need to move fast
      * High uncertainty
      * Beginning of projects
      * 6 sigma when they scale

* Questions
  * How do you stay relevant?
  * How do you get customers to buy in? (Need them to)
    * Bring them in, teach them methodology
    * Big customer education program
