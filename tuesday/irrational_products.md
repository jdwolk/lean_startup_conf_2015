Irrational Products
-------------------

* Speaker
  * Amir Shevat (Slack)

* Failures
  * Some failures can be overcome w/ smarter methodologies so you can fail at
    better things

* How do we experience products
  * Through conversation -- talking to eachother w/ no apps for millions of years
    * Having a conversation (in our mind) w/ our product

* Mistakes we Make
  * DEMO: (Personify product) -- talk to user

  * Asking for username / pass without providing value is irrational
    * User doesn't know what they're getting
    * For millions of years, we have negotiated. We understand give and take
    * Solution: show what the user is giving, ESPECIALLY when it's a new
      product

  * 2 flows:
    * Register -> Intro -> Feed
      * Very efficient for getting through flow, but ppl never came back to app
      * Optimizes getting through flow
    * Register -> Intro -> Invite Friend -> Upload Image
      * Very efficient for keeping users -- enforces virility
      * Optimized retention
    * Ppl will do a lot of "work" if they know what's in it for them
    * WIIFM == What's in it for me

* Solutions
  * Talk Your App
    * Personify app communication w/ another person
  * Observe behavior, not what ppl say
  * Be very data focused
    * Leverage anayltics to identify dropoff
