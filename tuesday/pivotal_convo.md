Convo w/ Pivotal folks
----------------------

* Clients
  * Prequalification? Training? Or both?
    * Almost all prequalification -- if ppl don't buy into, i.e.,
      colocating, lean, agile, everything involved w/ building MVP --
      they don't take the client
    * Also have a very strong brand, so clients more or less know what
      to expect

  * Was there a shift to that state as company grew, or were they always
    hardliners to their process and principles?
    * According to this dude, they've been that way since they were small

* Do members of product team do sales?
  * Not really

* How to balance speed w/ quality?
  * Client expectation management / not compromising on overall process
  * TDD + whole-team investment / visbility
    * Have project dashboards that everyone (including PM and client)
      have visbility into

* How to ensure culture is transmitted globally / office-to-office?
  * 1 product, 1 developer, 1 designer
  * When new office opens, team from office stays FOR A YEAR
    * Hires locally, instills process, establishes values

* What is the role of engineering in the lean startup?
  * Pushing for shipping functionality (see speed / quality above)
