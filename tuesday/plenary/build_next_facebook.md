* Patterns
  * "It's going to be huge!"

* "We're going to be the next FB"
  * When you say, presumably what you mean:
    * start w/ small, core group os users, solve specific problem
    * FB didn't open up to non-college students until 2006-
      limited user base to specific ppl w/ specific problem for 2 years
    * Identified core group of users, solve their problem

* Slack
  * B2B product
  * Build product solves problem w/ team you're REALLY close with
    * Slack started as internal tool for company
  * Same model as AWS -- started internally
  * Works well because team works REALLY closely w/ team their building
    product for
    * Good chance other ppl have same problem

* Airbnb
  * Do things that don't scale, A/B test like crazy to validate
  * Did things themselves until they couldn't

* Product Hunt
  * Create incredibly passionate community of users who care deeply about something
  * Test w/ out writing any code
  * Network/ hustle until email list is a community
    * Turn community into product

* Pattern
  * Products are hard to build (don't build them big to begin with)
  * None of these companies started out BIG
  * These things started REALLY small, focused, and limited at the beginning

* Mistakes
  * Worry about getting big before figuring out key users / business models
    * Need sustainable business model / sustainable unit economics
      * Make more money per user than u spend acquiring

* Big companies
  * Many products don't get out
  * "That wouldn't move the needle" -- idea considered too small
  * Conversely, push small ideas to EVERYONE at once
    * Products need time to find natural markets / grow naturally

* 1995
  * Internet didn't look big
  * CD-ROMs were the big thing, ppl didn't see the internet as a thing

* Can't just "Copy facebook"
  * Facebook didn't start out as facebook, you can't either

* Tips
  * Big things start small -- really small
    * Building everything for everyone is expensive and fraught w/ danger
  * Global things start locally
    * If it's hard to launch in one location, it's impossible to launch everywhere
    * It's hard to change stuff in many places. Also easy to kill things in only one place
  * Automated things start manually
    * Do things that don't scale until you can't
    * May find you don't have to build anything at all because no one wants it
  * 1 billion customers starts w/ 1
    * Every product has first customer. Focus on their experience. And the 100th, 1000th, 10000th
