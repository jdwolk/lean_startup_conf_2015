VP of Dropbox - Growth
---------------------

* Context
  * Aditya
  * At dropbox, one of original Facebook devs too

* How to grow over long term?

* We're in fast moving time
  * Exponential growth of access to information over last ~30 years
  * This means products spread really fast
  * AND companies are growing faster than ever

* Companies
  * Microsoft
  * Goole: 15 years, 60,000
  * Facebook: 8 years, 10,000 employees

* Traditional managers
  * Provide stability
  * Innovate slowly
  * Doesn't apply in fast growing companies

* His mantra
  * Everything will be broken. Make sure it's not too broken
  * Identify waht's broken, iterate, fix it

* FB
  * Started as social diretory for college students

* Question: How to evolve company across diff. aspects of engineering mgmt?
  * How used to do it vs. how today
  * Must keep evolving

* Values
  * Need "north star" through hyper growth -- values
  * Need to think hard about value appropriate to company
  * FB
    * Move fast and break things
      * kind of insane
      * FOR THEIR COMPANY, needed to get out to everyone for it to work.
        Needed to ship quick
    * Ship 3x daily
    * Bug mgmt live

    * DOESN'T APPLY TO DROPBOX -- can't drop data
  * Dropbox
    * "Sweat the details"
      * Completely opposite to most modern development methodology
    * How to find the right balance between moving fast and not breaking things?
  * There is no right value for every company
    * Empasize: product + culture

* Recruiting
  * Young company
    * Find: generalists, good learners, unicorns
    * Interview process filter for learning
      * How will you test for what ppl can know in future
  * Later (100's of millions o users)
    * Specialists at one thing
    * Problem: want to be innovative

* PDP
  * In the beginning, chaos is ok -- you don't need process
    * Everyone's in same room, you get communication for free
  * Larger (100's of ppl)
    * Need to communicate / coordinate
  * Dropbox
    * Try to formalize things happening organically
    * Push ppl to be open to change / chaos
    * Internally, have stuff w/ 0 users. Need to strike balance
      between building product at scale and product w/ 0 users

* Leads
  * Managers -- not traditional
    * Technically saavy
    * Not great at instituting process, scaling, coordinating
  * Over time, role of manager will change quickly
    * Team lead is best perfomer. Becomming manager sucks
    * Org must recognize this -- engineer -> manager -> BACK TO ENGINEER again

* Big takeaway
  * Even big companies haven't figured it out
  * Have penchant for change / introspection
  * What is good for company? What is good for particular team?
  * Companies need to evolve, no 1 model
