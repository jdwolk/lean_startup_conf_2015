How Data Can Save Hollywood

* Can you apply lean startup to storytelling?
  * Creating a good story is a lot like creating a good tech product

* Hollywood budgets are huge, but difficult to develop and tell what'll succeed
  * Case: Jupiter Ascending had huge budget, directors / producters (Wachowskis),
    right sci fi elements, but totally sucked

  * Process: like previously successful wntrepreneur raising money based on
    rep, spending 2 years developing product based on static business plan,
    and betting all on launch weekend

  * How to increase hit rate?
    * > 1/2 of successful movies are based on books
    * Validate story w/ good potential before betting the farm

  * Counterexample: The Martian
    * Andy Weir: Written by a dev :)
    * Released a chapter at a time on blog
      * Early readers gave feedback, incorporated into subsequent revisions

* What about data though? Can we use analytics to understand reader behavior?
  * Tell difference between good story and bad?
    * Tested excerpt of first 1000 words -- put online
    * Put analytics into website
    * 300 ppl / story

* Patterns
  * In best case: best stories had 35% completion rate
  * Maybe it's the media? Hypothesis: reading on mobile is hard
  * Testing -- tried different formats for story consumption
    * Text-message based story telling (WTF...)

* Does this kill creativity?
  * Storytellers traditionally went village-to-village
    * Got realtime data from audience
    * Data incorporated -- used to retell story better
