-------------------------------------

* Speaker
  Alex Osterwalder (Business Model Canvas)

* Culture
  * "Your company's culture is your OS"
    * Dave Gray
  * How can companies intentionally design company culture?

* No one wants the "Kodak Moment" anymore
  * Why did Kodak go under?
  * How much time / energy goes into right value proposition and business model?
    * Classic R&D isn't enough

* Why is it hard for existing (large) companies to transform how they work?
  * Continuum
    * Improvement to existing business models
      * Known environment, customers, market
      * Easy to make accurate predictions about growth
      * Emphasis on execution
      * Business plans + performance objectives
        * Failures not an option
    * Invent
      * Business models aren't proven
      * Unknwon environment, growth, market understanding
      * Emphasis on search for working business models
      * Need experimentation to improve business model
  * Need to be able to do both at the same time in an existing company
    * Companies that can't do this will become disposable companies

* What is corporate culture?
  * Our guess: values applied to day-to-day interractions?
  * His answer: not clear...
  * Dave Gray quotes
    * "If you want to understand a culture, you need to map it"
    * "Culture emerges because certain behaviors are rewarded or punished"

* How to map corporate culture?
  * Behaviors
    * How do ppl act or conduct themselves, esp. toward others
      * Ppl put up stickies to define what their behaviors are
      * Examples: 'ppl text before execution, test problems before solutions, etc'
  * Outcomes
    * Concrete positive or negative consequences resulting from out behavior
      * Answers the question: Why do we want that culture?
      * Examples: 'reduce risk of innovation, higher return on r&d'
  * Enables / Blockers:

    * What drives behavior / outcomes?
      * Gives exercise power
      * Prompts change by identifying outcomes to make desired outcomes easier
        and remove blockers
      * Examples: 'What blocks develpment of lean startup culture today, lack
        of knowledge and training, failure = career suicide, etc'

    * Leadership org. design
      * Even w/ leadership support and resource allocation, may still lack
        power to make things happen in large way
      * Need "CEO": Chief Entrepreneurship Officer, responsible for innovation

    * Culture and process,
      * Need startup champions

    * Organization design
      * Skills development -- many ppl in org don't know lean startup
      * Build rewards systems to encourage experimentation
      * Innvoation ppl shouldn't be seen as pirates; instead as partners

* 3 things to do to start designing culture
  * Take 10 mins, map culture. Think about enablers / blockers
  * Gather team, map and discuss
  * 1/2 day, design workshop to work from "as-is" to "to-be" culture
