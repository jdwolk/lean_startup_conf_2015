* Speaker
  * Amy Jo Kim

* Making MVP process better w/ game thinking

* Design experience to evolve over time
  * Requires systems thinking -- how things work, not how they look and feel

* Design w/ mastery at the end
  * Tactic: use framework
    * Diff. stages of experience
    * Map out what experience is over time, how it evolves

  * Framework
    * Discovery: what is this
    * Onboarding
    * Habit building: the day 21 experience. Pulls back, gets you better
    * Mastery: for ppl that have built up knowledge. Want to play a different game
      * The "Elder Game"

  * Example: Slack
    * Framework
      * Discovery: Pulled in by friends / colleagues
      * Onboarding: Learn the ropes by bot
        * Onboarded in single-player mode, using a bot
        * Allows you to enter "multiplayer mode" when ready
      * Habit building: multiplayer / co-op
        * Customizing experience makes it interesting
      * Mastery: extensible environment; enthusiasts can evolve experience
    * Evolves to match your skill level
      * Through system structure of team decisions

* Find fun within core loop first
  " Fun == learning
  * What is a game?
    * Classic definition: 0 sum game. I win, you lose
      * Head-to-head battles, rank ordered competitions, etc
    * Non-zero-sum game
      * Particpants are partners, tend to win/lose together
      * Examples: The Sims, Pictionary
  * Must think: what kind of fun / game are customers looking for?
    * Do they want to be partners? Or opponents?

  * In game design: core loop
    * Operant conditioning / skinner box
      * NEVER leaves to player delight, doesn't provide longterm engagement
    * Need skill building -- THIS is what hooks ppl

* Connect early w/ super fans
  * Solve a real problem for a small, dedicated group
