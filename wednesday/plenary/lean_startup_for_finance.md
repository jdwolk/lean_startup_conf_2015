* Finance team always says: What's the ROI?
  * Predicting revenue in future only works w/ long, established history
  * Process of figuring out ROI is total farse of tweaking spreadsheets
  * At some point, during review, revenue projections brought back out

* Finance's perspective
  * Job: allocate scarce resources of company

* The accounting is the problem
  * Shouldn't show ROI if possible, but if NEED TO
  * Financial options
    * Have the right to due something in the future, but not be locked into
      rates of present
    * Wherever there is uncertainty, you will find options to manage it

* What is an innovation option?
  * Takes place before main product
    * Lets you learn / test assumptions while still showing positive value
      for actions
  * Value = sum of the possibilities
    * There is a range of potential outcomes -- need to figure out which is which
    * First input: what will be spent
    * Second input: range of possible outcomes
    * Third iput: How many iterations over what period of time?
      * I.e. quarterly innovations over course of year
    * Value - investment = return on investment
    * At each step: things either go up, down, or stay the same
      * Only answering one question: given what we've learned since last iteration,
        are we better off, worse off, or same as we were before?

* Financial Option model omits risk
  * Risk (financial risk)
  * More frequently iteration occurs, more iteration goes down
    * Once a month: risk sigma - 0.4
  * Risk sigma is a normalized metric, comparative across projects
    * Can look at 2 projects and see which one should be pursued from financial
      perspective

* KPIs
  * Focus not ability to tell future, but on getting the truth, fast
  * First KPI: sigma
  * Second: the truth
    * Did we make the right decision
    * Lagging indicator
    * Accurate bad news >>> inaccurate good news
